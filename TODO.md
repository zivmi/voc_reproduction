## Results from the internet appendix

1. Figure IA5: Nonlinear prediction effects. (PDP plots)
2. Section VII. Comparison With Momentum
3. Inspect crisis periods, how is it able to time recessions?

## Future perspective

1. Additional XAI (PDP)
2. Control the leverage
3. Calibration assessment, and how can we calibrate models 
4. Factors
5. RFFs and their connection to SVMs, infinitely wide networks, etc.
6. Positioning, how the confidence of predictions changes with complexity
7. How to exploit the effect, ie how to build a single model
8. Weighted Ridge Regression, where weights are smaller for older data

## Cross-sectional

1. Instead of NNs, aren't boosted threes better for predicting panel data?


## Reading list

1. Hastie 2020
2. Kernal methods, RFFs, and SVMs
3. Double descent papers
